          <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
          <p class="description"> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or CS: GO, is a skill-driven first-person shooter that has stood the test of time. You’re either a terrorist or counter-terrorist, and your goal changes with the map—plant the bomb, defuse it, or rescue hostages. But beneath that simplicity is deep strategy and lightning-fast reflex gameplay. Every bullet matters, every decision counts, and every teammate can make or break a match. It runs efficiently on 4GB RAM PCs, especially if you tweak the graphics settings. Players love it for its fairness: everyone starts equal, and victory depends on practice and precision. The competitive mode is intense, but casual modes offer a more relaxed vibe. Skins and crates add a touch of customization, while community servers expand gameplay. Whether you're grinding ranked or just having fun with friends, CS: GO delivers adrenaline-pumping action without needing high-end specs. </p>

        <p class="meta"><strong>:</strong> <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare redefined the military shooter genre when it launched, and even today, it’s a blast to play. With just 4GB RAM, you can dive into its gripping single-player campaign that feels like a blockbuster movie—complete with intense firefights, plot twists, and cinematic moments. You’ll play as different soldiers across the globe, from stealth missions in Chernobyl to explosive battles in the Middle East. The controls are tight, and the guns feel powerful, offering a great sense of immersion. But what truly made this game iconic was its multiplayer mode. Fast-paced matches, killstreak rewards, perks, and customizable loadouts all started here. It runs smoothly on low-end PCs, making it accessible to almost everyone. Whether you're reliving the nostalgia or discovering it for the first time, Modern Warfare offers both depth and excitement in every match. It's military shooting at its most refined.</p>

        <h2>3. Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne </h2>
    
        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Max Payne 2 is not your average shooter—it’s a gritty, emotional ride through the eyes of a broken man. This third-person shooter brings cinematic storytelling and stylish gunplay together with its iconic “bullet time” mechanic, letting you slow down the action and dodge bullets like you're in a movie. You play as Max, a detective haunted by tragedy, navigating through a noir-inspired world filled with betrayal, pain, and non-stop action. The voice acting, moody soundtrack, and comic-book-style cutscenes make the experience unforgettable. Despite being released in the early 2000s, Max Payne 2 still feels satisfying to play today, especially on low-spec PCs with 4GB RAM. Its controls are responsive, and the level design pushes you to keep moving and experimenting with combat. It’s not just a shooter—it’s a story-driven experience that pulls you in and won’t let go until the final shot.

        <h2> 4. Far Cry 2</h2>
        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Far Cry 2 is an ambitious open-world shooter set in war-torn Africa, where you’re a mercenary caught between two rival factions. The game offers a raw, immersive survival experience where your gun can jam, vehicles break down, and enemies are relentless. Unlike modern shooters that hold your hand, Far Cry 2 throws you into a realistic world where every firefight feels unpredictable. With its dynamic fire system, you can start wildfires to trap enemies or clear paths. The day-night cycle and weather effects add depth to your strategy—do you attack at dawn or wait until nightfall? Despite being open-world, it runs well on systems with 4GB RAM if you tweak a few settings. It's perfect for players who enjoy realism, exploration, and tactical shooting. Far Cry 2 doesn’t just let you shoot—it makes you feel like you're fighting for survival in a brutal, beautiful environment.</p>

        <h2>5. Project IGI: I'm Going In</h2>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Genre:</strong>  | <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Project IGI is a stealth-focused tactical shooter that rewards patience and planning over run-and-gun action. You play as David Jones, a former SAS soldier sent on covert missions deep behind enemy lines. Instead of overwhelming you with fast-paced chaos, IGI encourages a slow, methodical approach—scout enemy bases, plan your entry, and strike with precision. The game's open maps give you multiple ways to complete objectives, and its realistic gun mechanics add to the challenge. What makes IGI stand out is its emphasis on stealth and real-world tactics, something many modern games overlook. It runs smoothly on even the most modest PCs, with 4GB RAM being more than enough. While the graphics are dated, the gameplay holds up surprisingly well and offers a unique, thoughtful shooting experience. If you enjoy stealth, strategy, and realistic missions, Project IGI is a hidden gem worth revisiting.

        <h2>6. Halo: Combat Evolved</h2>
        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Halo: Combat Evolved is more than just a sci-fi shooter—it’s a landmark title that changed gaming forever. You play as Master Chief, a super-soldier fighting to save humanity from a mysterious alien alliance called the Covenant. With tight gunplay, unique enemy AI, and an epic soundtrack, every mission feels like part of a grand space opera. The campaign mixes open-ended environments with intense firefights, while the futuristic setting keeps things fresh with alien tech, vehicles, and massive battles. It runs well on 4GB RAM PCs, especially the original or Custom Edition version. While newer Halo games are available, Combat Evolved remains a fan favorite for its balance of action, atmosphere, and story. The multiplayer is simple yet addictive, offering classic modes like Capture the Flag and Slayer. For those who want a shooter with heart, history, and heroism, Halo is still a must-play.

        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">
          
          Spec Ops: The Line isn’t your typical military shooter—it’s a psychological journey into the horrors of war. Set in a sand-buried Dubai, you play as Captain Martin Walker, leading a small team into a mission that quickly spirals out of control. On the surface, it feels like a standard third-person cover shooter, but as you progress, the game challenges your morals, choices, and even your sanity. The story is intense, emotional, and uncomfortably real, with powerful twists that leave a lasting impact. Gunplay is solid, with strategic use of cover and squad commands. It’s optimized well enough to run on 4GB RAM systems, especially on medium settings. Spec Ops isn’t about high scores or flashy moments—it’s about making you think. If you want a shooter that goes beyond bullets and bravado to explore the human cost of combat, this game will stay with you long after the credits roll.

        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Left 4 Dead 2 is the ultimate co-op zombie shooter that turns every playthrough into a unique, chaotic adventure. You and up to three friends (or AI teammates) must survive relentless waves of zombies while moving from one safe room to another across diverse, beautifully ruined locations. The magic lies in its “AI Director” — a system that changes enemy placements and events every time you play, keeping things fresh and unpredictable. From using frying pans and chainsaws to shotguns and pipe bombs, the weapon variety adds fun and flexibility. It runs very well on low-end PCs with 4GB RAM, making it accessible and fun for almost anyone. The game's pacing, teamwork, and humor create an experience that’s both thrilling and hilarious. Whether you’re a horror fan or just want to blast zombies with friends, Left 4 Dead 2 delivers nonstop fun that’s aged like fine wine.

        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">

         In Hitman: Blood Money, you become Agent 47—a professional assassin who kills with precision, style, and stealth. Unlike most shooters, you’re rewarded for blending in and taking out targets quietly rather than going in guns blazing. Each mission is like a deadly sandbox, letting you choose how and when to strike. Poison their drink? Cause an “accident”? Or walk away unnoticed? The game gives you freedom and creativity rarely seen in shooters. The storyline is compelling, as you uncover a conspiracy while navigating contracts across varied, detailed environments—from opera houses to Mardi Gras parades. With smart gameplay and low system requirements, it’s perfect for 4GB RAM PCs. Blood Money strikes a balance between action and intelligence, making you feel like a true hitman. It’s not about the body count—it’s about the perfect kill.

        <h2>10. Borderlands</h2>
        <p class="meta"><strong></strong>  <strong>Size:</strong> </p>
        <p class="description">Borderlands is a wild, loot-filled shooter with a comic-book style and quirky humor that sets it apart. Set on the lawless planet Pandora, you choose one of four unique characters and dive into a world full of bandits, monsters, and treasure. The gameplay mixes fast-paced FPS combat with RPG elements—you’ll level up, earn skills, and chase powerful weapons dropped randomly. With millions of possible gun variations, no two players will have the same arsenal. Borderlands runs surprisingly well on low-spec machines with 4GB RAM, especially the original version. It’s packed with solo and co-op content, meaning you can play alone or with friends for double the fun. The writing is clever, the enemies are bizarre, and the action never stops. If you're looking for a shooter that doesn’t take itself too seriously but still offers great gameplay depth, Borderlands is an absolute blast.
