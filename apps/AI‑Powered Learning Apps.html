  <h2>3. Notion AI</h2>
  <p><strong>Notion AI</strong> transforms the already powerful Notion workspace into an intelligent assistant that helps students work smarter, not harder. Notion is widely used for note-taking, task management, and project planning — but with AI built right into the platform, it becomes an all-in-one productivity powerhouse.

  <h2>5. ChatGPT</h2>
  <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> acts as a 24/7 AI tutor, study partner, and brainstorming assistant for students at all levels. By simply typing a question, students can receive explanations for difficult concepts, get help drafting essays, or generate quiz-style questions for self-practice. For those struggling with time management, ChatGPT can create personalized study schedules or break down complex topics into smaller, more digestible steps. This conversational interface makes learning interactive and less intimidating.</p>
  <p>Unlike static textbooks, ChatGPT can adapt its answers based on follow-up questions, allowing students to explore topics deeply.

Students preparing for exams like SATs or competitive tests can use it to practice sample questions, solve math problems step by step, or get quick refreshers on theory before an exam.
